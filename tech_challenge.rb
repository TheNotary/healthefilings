  # Terminology:
  #
  # Given the string "aabbccddx", there exists 1 *flake* (it's 'x').
  # A flake is a character that is easier to completely remove than it is to
  # decrement the occurences of all other characters more frequent than said flake
  # (it flakes off easily).
  #
  # Given the string "aabbccddx", if the letter 'a' were chosen to be the
  # *match_target*, letters b, c, and d would not need to be decremented at all
  # because they already match the frequency of letter 'a'.  However the number
  # of occurences of 'x' would need to be removed to completely eliminate
  # it from the string.  That is to say that if 'a' were selected as a
  # match_target only one removal step would be required to eliminate the flake
  # 'x'.
  #
  # smart_reduction_count_process will accept a string, say "aaabbccddx" and
  # return the integer 2 as that the optimal number of steps required to make
  # the string valid are 2; *one* step to remove an 'a' such that the letter 'a'
  # is as frequent as the match_target of b (c, or d could also be chosen as
  # match targets).  Additionally *one* step would be required to remove the
  # letter 'x' from the string entirely.
